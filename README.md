# gambling-arb
This program will function as a webscraper that will use actionnetwork in order to pull the best odds for each MLB game. The program will then use these odds to convert to implied probability in order to find arbitrage. This project is current, so the included features are not finalized, and I hope to expand to different sports leagues/increase functionality.
